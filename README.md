# Machine Learning From Scratch üß†‚ú®

Welcome to this repository!  
Here you‚Äôll find a growing collection of **machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch in Python**.  

The goal of this repo is to help you **learn the core concepts of machine learning** by breaking down each algorithm step by step, without relying on high-level libraries like `scikit-learn`.  

---

## üìö What You‚Äôll Learn
- How fundamental ML algorithms are built and why they work.  
- Hands-on implementations of models such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - K-Means Clustering
  - and many more (coming soon!)
- Mathematical intuition behind each algorithm.  
- How to apply these algorithms on real-world datasets.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Structure
Each algorithm/module is organized in its own folder:
- **Python code** implementing the algorithm.  
- **README.md** with explanations, usage examples, and key concepts.  

Example:
- Added [Linear Regression](./linear_regression/README.md)
- Added [Polynomial Regression](./polynomial_regression/README.md)
